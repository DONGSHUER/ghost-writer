                Ghost-writing is a unique delivery service by client-entrusted companies or self-organized teams for
                writing academic papers and assignments. Customers only need to provide information about the subject's
                requirements and the expected completion time of the task. By completing academic work based on
                pre-conditions, the ghost-writers could take money but none of the credit for the produced work.

                    The number of students pursuing study overseas is growing snowballing in China. Faced with the
                    learning
                    pressures, some Chinese students try to avoid studying work and ask for outside help. The
                    ghost-writing
                    services came next, enabling the set-up of a number of websites and social media accounts.
                    <br><br>
                    Joey, a ghost-writer with abroad studying experience in America, shared a scenario when he studied
                    abroad: the on-campus students who chose to have ghost-writing services were too lazy to finish the
                    homework but somehow hoping to get satisfactory marks.
                    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190329-the-essay-mills-that-help-students-cheat">As
                        the BBC

                Demands for ghost-writing will never be sufficient as the non-stopping trend of study abroad in China.
                There are two kinds of 'professional' service providers occupying the ghost-writing market, including
                the agents and self-organized teams. Running ghost-writing as an official business, they have built
                their network delicately with three employee types: customer service staff, the recruiter, and
                ghost-writers.<br><br>

            It is easy for individuals to start writing services. You could promote yourself on social platforms as long
            as you have the required skills. For example, there is an "international student" tag on Weibo. The students
            who need service will write down their requirements, and the writers will put on their transcripts. If they
            are satisfied with each other, the transaction carries out. Subsequently, the individuals as "shadow
            scholars" can organize to form a writing agent or team. Joey said that he couldn't find a job when he
            graduated, and then he invited a few friends to set up a ghost-writing organization.

                are well-organized enterprises in ghost-writing. Among them, Simpletense
                is a company that mainly serves to write English papers with its sub-company working on science
                subjects, while Student League focuses explicitly on science and finance.

                    Simpletense advertises on their official website that they have native language writers and North
                    American universities' admissions officers as a gimmick to attract students and writers. We
                    reflected on
                    the fact after asking to be one of the essay-writers and got refused for not being a native speaker.
                    Simpletense claims to be an
                    educational institution officially registered in America.

                Student League claims their writers are mainly doctors and doctors from famous universities all around
                the world. However, we pretended to be writers. The recruiter started the conversation, "What university
                year are you in now?" she asked. We checked the company address on the bottom of its website, which
                verified to be fake, pointing to the address of Southern California university.

                    Moreover, it is worth noting that they will not clearly state that they provide writing services but
                    define themselves as an "educational institution." Additionally, the writer's pictures displayed on
                    Simpletense's website is a fashion model on Unspanish. We then looked for the writers' names on
                    Linkedin
                    and found that they were not actually in this company.

                The lack of standardization in the industry of ghost-writing can cause a lot of problems for the
                consumers, among which the work quality cannot be guaranteed is the biggest one. Some ghost-writers
                choose to simply offer students essays of poor quality or offer a paper to several students for
                cost-saving, either of which will leave the students a fail grade. Nevertheless, some self-claimed
                ghost-writers even cheat students only for the deposit, and no essays will be given after the students
                get blacklisted by the con man.

                    Rae, a Chinese 21-year-old accounting student, studying in Europe, got trolled in a crucial exam by
                    a ghost-writing agency called essay master this September. Rae got acquainted with this agency's
                    staff in a WeChat group for students abroad to buy return tickets. Later, to get a higher grade in a
                    vital financing test, Rae decided to make her first attempt at purchasing the ghost-writing service.
                    The deal was finally made at the price of 1300 yuan.
                    <br><br>
                    However, to Rae's surprise and anger, after 3 hours' exam time, the agency just gave her an answer
                    for a 9-point question out of the 100-point paper. The agency apologized that they don't know their
                    ghost-writer cannot handle this test, but they only agreed to return half of the price." I won't buy
                    any ghost-writing works anymore." said Rae. After finding the fraud, Rae could do nothing but
                    scolding the agency to express her dissatisfaction.

                Normally, the rights and interests of consumers of ghost-writing are not protected by the law. According
                to the Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China, the right of the person of the work cannot be
                transferred to anybody else. Meanwhile, the deal of ghost-writing also violates the Regulations of the
                People's Republic of China on Academic Degrees. Therefore, the contracts between consumers and
                ghost-writers are invalid, which means any loss under these contracts will not be saved.

                Although many students get used to using ghost-writing in their academic lives, the behavior of using
                ghost-writing has always suffered a lot of controversies about justice.
                <br><br>
                "I don't think it's fair towards other students." Nick was a Ukrainian student majoring in business
                information management at the University of California, Irvine. He held firm opposition views towards
                ghost-writing. Nick explained:" Because you know, for many reasons, other students might not be able to
                have access to such a resource, they might not be able to afford it. I see how this can affect my peers
                and my friends."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Legally, ghost writing is strictly prohibited. According to Prevention and treatment of academic
                misconduct in Colleges and Universities published in 2016, anyone who get involved in the transactions
                of academic essays, including both ghostwriters and consumers, will be published. For the students,
                their degrees will be canceled and they may lose their qualifications to apply for the degree.

        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                However, universities meet with some difficulties in distinguishing the pieces written by ghost-writers.
                As Mr. Wang, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, suggested that universities'
                primary system to check students' works, Turnitin, can only conduct two types of checking, intragroup
                checking and public database checking. Mr. Wang stated that both ways could do little in picking out
                ghost-writing ones because they can only check similarities of different works." Only if the
                ghost-writers produce something that they're here before, the Turnitin system can report its high
                similarity."
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                And even if the pieces have been distinguished by the system and teachers, those found guilty of
                academic misconduct can also escape from punishments with some agencies' assistance. An agency called
                FindingSchool gave a case of helping students out of this dilemma. Firstly, they helped the student
                write a letter of appeal to the professor. Then the agency held rehearsals of hearings for the student
                many times. Finally, the student got mitigation successfully, with the suspension punishment lessened to
                probation.
